    <section id="personal_description"> 
        I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, studying Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.
        I am co-advised by <a href="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/duraisamy-karthik/">Prof. Karthik Duraisamy</a> of the <a href="https://caslab.engin.umich.edu">Computational Aerosciences Laboratory</a> and <a href="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/martins-joaquim-r-r-a/">Prof. Joaquim R. R. A. Martins</a> of the <a href="https://mdolab.engin.umich.edu">Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Laboratory</a>.
        My research work is on gradient-based multidisciplinary design optimization for urban air mobility vehicles, specifically studying noise-constrained vehicle design.
        Within my research work, I have implemented a framework for variable-fidelity aerostructuralacoustic optimization, considering propeller-wing interaction.
        This work has resulted in various collaborations across universities, as well as with NASA, Hyundai Motor Company, A3 by Airbus, and Design Analysis Research Corporation.
        In 2020 I obtained my Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, where I will complete my Masters Degree in Aerospace Engineering in the Spring of 2023, while working on my Ph.D.
        <br><br>
        Before attending the University of Michigan, I graduated from Princeton University in 2018 with a degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with certificates in Robotics and Intelligent Systems as well as Materials Science.
        My research work while at Princeton focused on bats and their complex flight behavior, studying the micro-hair sensors on their wings that appear to have an effect on their flight patterns.
        Working with Prof. Hultmark in the FAST lab, I was able to design and attempt to build a bio-inspired hair sensor in the Andlinger PRISM Cleanroom, using a variety of micro-fabrication techniques.
        In addition to my research work, I was selected by the Keller Center for Entrepreneurship at Princeton to develop a real-time monitoring system to help ensure safety for athletes with disabilities, while in training or competition.
        <br><br>
        Throughout high school, undergraduate, and graduate schooling I have taken part in several internship programs, beginning as a Research Intern at Veryst Engineering LLC. in Needham, MA, performing multiphysics simulations of fluid structure interaction.
        While at Princeton, I spent a summer working in Germany at the Institut f√ºr Photonische Technologien (Erlangen, Germany) as a research intern. While at the institute I participated in the development of a computational solver for Laser Welding, enhancing the features and accuracy of the simulation tool.
        During my time there I was also part of a team that worked on building a 2-axis Laser Welding machine, for which I was responsible for developing the electronics, firmware, and interface software that control the laser welding head and specimen for each trial.
        Before completing my work at Princeton, I spent a summer working at Pratt and Whitney as an advanced engine design intern.
        While at Pratt and Whitney I worked on low-pressure compressor core design running structural design optimization cases.
        In graduate school, I collaborated with A3 by Airbus, developing a computational aeroacoustic solver for rotorcraft applications.
        This work was specifically geared towards their electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle called Vahana, and has expanded into a component of my Ph.D. research work.
