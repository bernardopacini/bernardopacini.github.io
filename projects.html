        <p><strong>Description:</strong> TigerElectric is an aircraft for the 2017-2018 AIAA Undergraduate Design competition, designing two hybrid-electric general aviation aircraft. For this analysis, an aircraft wight and sizing calculation toolbox was developed to handle hybrid-electric aircraft. The battery power system was rigorously developed and optimized for the specified mission requirements. The design was modeled and tested using CFD, CAD, and CAE tools. Furthermore, the aircrafts' control systems, dynamics, and even business outlook were analyzed to understand the overall development of the TigerElectric project. </p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This tool box is designed for the preliminary stages of an aircraft's design process. The software provides initial maximum takeoff weight and surface area estimates as well as sizing parameters for the fuselage, wings, and tails. This program is designed to function in a design iteration loop using OpenVSP or other aircraft modeling and analysis software. </p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Starboii is a semi-autonomous search and rescue robot. Starboii is capable of traversing difficult terrain, climbing a 1ft wall, navigating autonomously through a tunnel, and tracking a light. Starboii is also able to autonomously deliver a medical kit to a victim in need. The robot is controlled by a Teensy 3.0 and is made of aluminum. Starboii won Princeton's MAE 322 Mechanical Design competition, successfully completing the entire robot testing course. </p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This was a two-part design project to design a rotating wingbox. Initially, the 22" wingbox was designed and analyzed to lift 220lbs at a weight of 1.8lbs. With the crane arm assembled and tested, the rotating mechanism and mount was designed. The arm and mount were required to rotate 20&deg; and lift 130lbs&mdash;this was accomplished successful with no sign of damage or weakening. </p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Partnered with Leapfrog 3D Printers, Rocket Project is a demonstration of the capabilities of the Creatr HS printer. The 3D printed rocket is a design prototype of a 1 meter tall rocket powered by 4 hybrid rocket engines and equipped with electronics for control and flight sensing. The prototype rocket also tests a unique parachute deployment system that does not rely on detonation of a charge. Each component of the rocket is individually printed using the Materialise Slicing software and the Creatr HS printer. </p>
