description: Partnered with Leapfrog 3D Printers, Rocket Project is a demonstration of the capabilities of the Creatr HS printer. The 3D printed rocket is a design prototype of a 1 meter tall rocket powered by 4 hybrid rocket engines and equipped with electronics for control and flight sensing. The prototype rocket also tests a unique parachute deployment system that does not rely on detonation of a charge. Each component of the rocket is individually printed using the Materialise Slicing software and the Creatr HS printer.

<h4>CAD</h4>
<project_subdescription_text>The <em>Rocket Project</em> is a program to design and 3D print an entire miniature rocket using a Leapfrog Creatr HS printer. The rocket is designed with features that mimic large-rockets, such as the independently fueled hybrid rocket engines which can be manipulated for thrust vectoring. The rocket is divided in two major sections, the lower comprising of the four engines assembled as one block with four tanks for the propulsions oxidizer. The upper section is comprised of a parachute chamber equipped with three electronically-fired parachutes for a stable and level descent along with a compartment for instrumentation and control components.</project_subdescription_text>

<h4>3D Printing</h4>
<project_subdescription_text>The entire rocket is printed using a Leapfrog Creatr HS 3D Printer. The rocket is over a meter in height and is thus printed in over 40 individual parts. This construction and assembly reflects the way it would be assembled when manufactured for a real mission. To display compatibility and accuracy, industry standard fasteners and seals are integrated into the assembly of the rocket. The Creatr HS is a versatile printer which is capable of printing on a host of different materials with different slicing strategies. For this project, the rocket is printed using Leapfrog's MAXX Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a commonly used filament for engineering, with the <em>Leapfrog Materialise</em> print slicing software. These prints have totaled over 200 hours and various kilograms of filament.</project_subdescription_text>
