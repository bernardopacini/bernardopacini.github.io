dates: August 2017 - May 2018
description: TigerElectric is an aircraft for the 2017-2018 AIAA Undergraduate Design competition, designing two hybrid-electric general aviation aircraft. For this analysis, an aircraft wight and sizing calculation toolbox was developed to handle hybrid-electric aircraft. The battery power system was rigorously developed and optimized for the specified mission requirements. The design was modeled and tested using CFD, CAD, and CAE tools. Furthermore, the aircrafts' control systems, dynamics, and even business outlook were analyzed to understand the overall development of the TigerElectric project.
